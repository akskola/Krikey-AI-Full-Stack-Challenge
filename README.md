# Krikey AI Full Stack Challenge Submission

## Introduction

This repository contains my submission for the Krikey Full Stack Challenge.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories, each specifically tailored to different components of the full stack challenge:

- **Part 2A/node-api**: This directory contains the Node.js API implementation, responsible for serving the backend logic.
- **Part 3/krikey-ui**: This directory hosts the React application, which forms the frontend of the challenge.

## Detailed Instructions

Each of the key directories (listed above) includes a dedicated `README.md` file. These READMEs contain:

- Specific answers and explanations relevant to the tasks and questions posed in the challenge.
- Step-by-step instructions on how to run and test each part of the application on your local machine.

### How to Use This Repository
